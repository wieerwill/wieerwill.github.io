# simple Business Card for Online Presentation
Hi there and welcome,
with GitHub you can Present yourself easily and without a fee.

  1. Step: Create a repository with the name: "YOURUSERNAME.github.io"
  2. Step: Upload or create your Webfiles (HTML, CSS, JS) into that repository
  3. Step: you are finished

I uploaded a simple Business Card for presentation of myself. Feel free to use it as a template but please refer to me.
People love it when something moves and changes it's shape, so use the power of CSS and JS to create an interactive and rememberable portfolio.

And as so often: No Commercial use allowed!

Have fun!
